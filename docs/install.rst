`!pgmp` extension installation
==============================

Prerequisites
-------------

`!pgmp` is currently compatible with:

- PostgreSQL from version 9.4
- GMP from version 4.1 (tested with versions 4.1.4, 4.2.4, 4.3.2, 5.0.1, 6.1.2,
  6.2.0).

.. note::
    GMP 4.1 doesn't implement a few functions (`rootrem()`, `combit()`,
    `randinit_mt()`) and the maximum base accepted by the I/O functions is
    36, not 62.

In order to build the library your system must have the server development
files (on Debian systems usually packaged as ``postgresql-server-dev``) and
regular UNIX development tools, such as :program:`make`. The
:program:`pg_config` program should be available in the :envvar:`PATH`. If
more than one PostgreSQL version is available on the system, the library will
be built against the version of the first :program:`pg_config` found in the
path. You may also override the selection specifying the :envvar:`PG_CONFIG`
variable.


Using the PGXN client
---------------------

If the prerequsites are met you can use the `PGXN Client`__ to download,
build, and install `!pgmp`, e.g.::

    $ pgxn install pgmp
    $ pgxn load -d somedb pgmp

.. __: https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/

The further instructions are to build, test, and install the library without
using the PGXN Client.


Building the library
--------------------

The library must be built and installed to be used with a database cluster:
once it is built, SQL installation scripts can be used to install the data
types and functions in one or more databases.

To build and install the library:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

You can test the installation with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make installcheck

(adjust the :envvar:`REGRESS_OPTS` variable to select a test database).

.. note::
    Because of the missing functions in GMP 4.1 (see Prerequisites_), a few
    tests are expected to fail with this library version. After running the
    test suite you may check the ``regression.diff`` file to verify that the
    only tests failed are the ones related to the missing functionalities and
    the different default random numbers gerenator algorithm.


Installing the extension
------------------------

With PostgreSQL versions before 9.1, an install script called ``pgmp.sql`` is
installed in the directory :samp:`{$sharedir}/pgmp`: just run the script into
a database to install the provided types and functions. An uninstall script is
also provided in the same directory to remove the installed objects.

With PostgreSQL 9.1 the library is packaged as an extension: once built and
installed in the cluster, use the command:

.. code-block:: psql

    =# CREATE EXTENSION pgmp;

to install it in a database. If your database was migrated from a previous
PostgreSQL version, you can convert the `!pgmp` objects into a packaged
extension using the command:

.. code-block:: psql

    =# CREATE EXTENSION pgmp FROM unpackaged;

In order to uninstall the extension you can use the ``DROP EXTENSION``
command. Please refer to `the documentation`__ for further informations about
PostgreSQL extensions management.
